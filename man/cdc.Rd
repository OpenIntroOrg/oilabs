\details{
The BRFSS is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United
States collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in
the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example,
respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their
HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare
coverage. The \href{http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/}{BRFSS Web site} contains a
complete description of the survey, the questions that were asked and even
research results that have been derived from the data.
