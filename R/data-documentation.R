#' Male and female births in London
#'
#' Arbuthnot's data describes male and female christenings (births) for
#' London from 1629-1710.
#'
#' John Arbuthnot (1710) used these time series data to carry out the first
#' known significance test. During every one of the 82 years, there were more
#' male christenings than female christenings. As Arbuthnot wondered,
#' we might also wonder if this could be due to chance, or whether it meant
#' the birth ratio was not actually 1:1.
